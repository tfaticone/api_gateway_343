# api_gateway_343

## Production Link
[https://api-gateway-343.herokuapp.com/](https://api-gateway-343.herokuapp.com/)

## Description
This repository is for the API gateway. This gateway will provide authentication and tokens 
that will be used for any authenticated API calls. Furthermore, this will act as an intermediary between
all the silos. Specifically, all silos that need to do an API call will contact the API gateway instead of
going directly to the API.

documentation. The only change that will follow is the base URL will be replaced
with the production link and a prefix will be added for each silo. As in the url will
follow the syntax:

`https://api-gateway-343.herokuapp.com/{prefix}/{querystring}`

#### Authentication - Token Use

All API requests will have to contain a token in the request. This token will be placed in the `Authorization` 
field in the header. This token is considered a Bearer token so the formal will be as follows:

`"Authorization" : "Bearer {token}"`

##### Example

`"Authorization" : "BEARER eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InRlc3QxIiwiYWNjb3VudFR5cGUiOiJlbXBsb3llZSIsImlkIjoyLCJpYXQiOjE1MjM1NDU3MDN9.-BnWLfBM2BXkqZFYP41F4qzj_ksQdT7wZzgbCSZR-lY"`
